/**
 * Regular Expressions
 *
 * Regular expressions (regexes) are a set of characters that define a search pattern.
 *
 * The constructor for the RegExp object takes two parameters:
 * the regular expression and the optional match settings, as shown here:
 *
 * i ==> Perform case-insensitive matching
 * g ==> Perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after first match)
 * m ==> Perform multiline matching
 *
 * RegExp has the following two functions:
 * 1. search(): Tests for matches in a string. This returns the index of the match.
 * 2. match(): Tests for matches. This returns all the matches.
 *
 * The JavaScript String object also has the following two regex-related functions that accept the RegExp object as an argument:
 * 1. exec(): Tests for matches in a string. This returns the first match.
 * 2. test(): Tests for matches in a string. This returns true or false.
